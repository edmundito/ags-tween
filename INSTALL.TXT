How to Install
==============

Export the module file
----------------------

You will need to export the module first in order to import it to your local game.

1. Open the demo game Game.agf in Tween folder.
2. Under "Explore Projects" expand "Scripts" alongside with the folder "Tween".
3. Select the "Tween" module that you would like to import to your game.
4. "Right-click --> Export..." the selected module.
5. Save it locally and give it the same name as the module indicates, for example "Tween1Compatiblity.scm"

Import the module file previously exported
------------------------------------------

1. Open the AGS Editor and your game.
2. Remove the existing Tween module from the AGS Editor: Right-click on it and select "Delete".
3. Import Tween.scm: Right-click in Scripts and select "Import..."
4. Make sure that the Tween module is at the top or close to the top of the script list:
      In AGS 3.3 or above you can drag the script.
      In earlier versions, you can right-click and select "Move Up" until it's at the top.
5. If you were using Tween 1.x, then you can also import Tween1Compatiblity.scm.
      Make sure that it is placed right below the Tween script module.
6. If you were using some AGS features that have been deprecated, then you can also import Tween2Compatiblity.scm.
      Make sure that it is placed right below the Tween script module.

Note: in order to Move Up / Down modules, you will need first to create a New Folder. Only folders can be moved.
      Create the folder called "Tween", move de module inside, "right-click" the folder and move it to the top list.
