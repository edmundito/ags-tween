Revision History
================
1.5 (2012)
- Added WaitForTweensToStop which allows waiting for all non-looping tweens to be done.
- Added ability to tween positions based on speed instead of time
- Added utility function GetDistance(fromX, fromY, toX, toY)
- Changed the way the module refers to objects internally, costing less memory per tween object and simplifying the code
- Tween position, size, and stop functions for GUI Controls have been unified into one
- Deprecated GUI Control Specific functions for AGS 2.x can be enabled by commenting out the TWEEN_1_2_LEGACY_FUNCTIONS_DISABLED define
- Renamed TweenViewportXY to TweenViewportPosition for consistency
-- Can be reenabled with the if TWEEN_1_2_LEGACY_FUNCTIONS_DISABLED is commented
- Renamed the NO_VER_2_TWEENS define to AGS_2_COMPATIBLE_TWEENS_DISABLED
- Migrated demo code to AGS 3.2.1
- Added new Strict audio tweens in AGS 3.2
- Added support for tweening the System.Volume in AGS 3.2
- Added custom default timing and styles for Audio Tweens
- eReverseRepeatTween now reverses the timing, too!
- Increased default max number of simultaneous tweens from 10 to 16

1.22 (August 14 2010)
- Restored compatibility with AGS 2.72 and 3.0!
- Added optional GetColorFromRGB(red, green, blue) function to 2.72. It can be exposed by uncommenting it in the script header.
1.21 (June 12 2010)
- Compatible with AGS 3.2. Note that support for most audio tweens only work if the "Enforce new-style audio scripting" is set to False.

1.2 (June 5 2010)
- New: You can now change the defaults for TweenTiming and TweenStyle.
  (GUIs have their own defaults, and NOTE that as of this version GUIs are blocking by default.)
- New: You can now set how tweens stop, whether they pause, finish, or reset (thanks to Dualnames for the inspiration!)
- New: WaitSeconds(seconds), very handy for timing things instead of guessing number of loops with regular Wait()
- General code cleanup, removed some redundancies
- Better code documentation

1.1 (February 17 2010)
- Now supports virtually every function that could be tweened in AGS
